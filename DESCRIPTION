Description: INDExA is a differential abundance/expression tool for the analysis
             of DNA sequence count data (or potentially other sequence count data).
	     It is useful for analyzing RNA-seq or 16S rRNA-seq. It allows researchers
	     to define interval assumptions to account for uncertainty in normalizations
	     and/or the unmeasured scale. These interval assumptions are integrated into
	     the null hypothesis testing framework itself through interval null hypothesis
	     tests.
